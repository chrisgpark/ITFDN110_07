# Assignment 7

**Objective**
In this assignment, I explore exception handling and pickling module in Python. To fulfill requirements of this assignment, I have scripted a simple program that allows user to enter contact (name and phone number) to be saved to and loaded back onto the program from a .dat file.   

**Scripting**
Start the script by defining variables.

Start a loop allowing the user to add contact to .dat file, while informing user of errors with try/except

Once the first loop ends, start another loop to list contact on .dat file.

**Running the Program**
Running the code on PyCharm:

Running the code on OSX terminal:

As seen above, code runs successfully on both PyCharm and terminal.

**Summary**
In this project, I learned about about exception handling and pickling in Python. Exception handling is essential to include for end users, as it allows developers to manage errors. Meanwhile, pickling allows efficient handling of data, when compared to processing data from a text file.
